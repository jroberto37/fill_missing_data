*************************************

The Level 1 and Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System (LAADS) provides
land and Atmosphere science communities and general users with rapid and
flexible access to large volumes of MODIS data from the NASA EOS Terra and
Aqua spacecraft, MAS data from NASA aircraft campaigns, VIIRS data from
NASA/NOAA Suomi NPP Spacecraft, and MERIS data from ESA's ENVISAT satellite.

The LAADS system takes advantage of low cost of disk storage to retain several
petabytes of data on-line. The LAADS now archives MODIS Level 0 data acquired
from EDOS, MODIS Atmosphere and Land Level 1, Level 2, Level 3,  and Level 4
products produced at MODAPS,  NPP Level 0 (RDR) from IDPS, Level 1 (SDR),
Level 2 and Level 3 (EDR) products produced at Land PEATE,  MERIS Level 1
(FR and RR) Products,  eMAS data from  various campaigns collected over the
past two decades,  and ancillary data acquired from GES DAAC and  other
sources. Following sections explain LAADS data archive and distribution
process by instrument.

The users not only can browse, select, and order data through LAADS website,
but also can directly access LAADS archive by using LAADS FTP server,
ftp://ladsftp.nascom.nasa.gov, without having to submit orders.  Users can
also search and order data by using LAADS Web Services
(http://ladsweb.nascom.nasa.gov/data/web_services.html).

LAADS is designed to perform searches and orders in seconds except in
circumstances requiring post processing or regeneration of data through
Processing On Demand (POD). LAADS includes a wide variety of post processing
capabilities included in response to request from the user community. These
include metadata searches, recurring temporal searches, geographic
sub-setting, parameter sub-setting, sub-sampling, masking, mosaicing,
reprojection, and GeoTIFF parameter conversion.

*MODIS*
*******

MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) is a key instrument
aboard the Terra (EOS AM) and Aqua (EOS PM) satellites. Terra's orbit around
the Earth is timed so that it passes from north to south across the equator in
the morning, while Aqua passes south to north over the equator in the
afternoon. Terra MODIS and Aqua MODIS are viewing the entire Earth's surface
every 1 to 2 days, acquiring data in 36 spectral bands. These data will
improve our understanding of global dynamics and processes occurring on the
land, in the oceans, and in the lower atmosphere. MODIS is playing a vital
role in the development of validated, global, interactive Earth system models
able to predict global change accurately enough to assist policy makers in
making sound decisions concerning the protection of our environment.

At present, LAADS MODIS archive consists of data products from Collection 3 to
Collection 6 and product Level 0 to Level 4. The range of data available for
distribution under each Collection is from a few products for certain years to
all products for the whole mission as follows:

- MODIS Collection 3 - Atmosphere 2002 Golden Data Set
- MODIS Collection 4 - Atmosphere 2002 Golden Data set
- MODIS Collection 4 - Gap Filled and Smoothed Land Products for NACP
- MODIS Collection 4.1 - Land Surface Temperature
- MODIS Collection 5 - L1, Atmosphere (Aqua 2002-2008, Terra 2000-March 2010)
  and Land
- MODIS Collection 5.1 - Selected Atmosphere and Land Products
- MODIS Collection 5.5 - Selected Land Products
- MODIS Collection 6 - L1. Atmosphere and Land data will be available after
  2012

MODIS products made available to users through LAADS system are grouped by
satellite (Terra, Aqua, or combined) and by processing level in the following
manner:

- Terra & Aqua Level 0 Products
- Terra & Aqua Level 1 Products
- Terra & Aqua Atmosphere Level 2 Products
- Terra & Aqua/Combined Atmosphere Level 3 Products

- Terra & Aqua/Combined Land Level 3/Level 4 Yearly Tiled Products
- Terra NACP 8-Day and Annual Tiled Products

To facilitate MODIS Level 2 swath products users in  delineating data
boundaries, LAADS has developed a simple text, GeoMeta Product file. This file,
taken directly from the Collection 5 MODIS Geolocation Products, MOD03/MYD03,
contains granule corner-point latitudes and longitudes along with
north/south/east/west bounding coordinates. Also, there are a number of other
parameters such as the Collection, OrbitNumber, and DayNightFlag included in
this file. For a complete information access the GeoMeta readme file at:

  ftp://ladsweb.nascom.nasa.gov/geoMeta/README

There are 2 types of data archives on LAADS, a permanent archive that is
available forever and a rolling archive. The rolling archive, such as Datapool,
saves products on rolling basis for at least 30 days (may be longer depending
on the disk usage) before data go offline. MODIS data, either LAADS permanent
archive data or rolling-archive data in the Datapool, are stored in LAADS in a
universal and predefined directory structure based on ArchiveSet (AS)
(associated with Collections),  ESDT,  Data-Year,  and Data-Day:

/allData/Archiveset number (AS)/ESDT/YYYY/DDD/  where ESDT is the product
shortname, YYYY is the 4-digit data year, and DDD is 3-digit data day number.
Please note that the product shortname for Terra MODIS start with MOD and the
same with Aqua MODIS start with MYD.

For example,   the Collection 5 Aqua Geolocation data (MYD03) of data-day
2006042,  is stored in archive  directory "allData/5/MYD03/2006/042/".

A brief description of MODIS data available for download from the LAADS ftp
server  listed by ArchiveSet is given below:

MAIAC MODIS Data for Amazon Basin:

 The MultiAngle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) is a new
advanced algorithm which uses time series analysis and a combination of pixel-
and image-based processing to improve accuracy of cloud detection, aerosol
retrievals and atmospheric correction. Current dataset presents the full
geophysical data record over Amazon basin (~55 600km tiles) from both MODIS
Terra (from 2000) and Aqua (from 2002). MAIAC provides suites of 1km
atmospheric and surface gridded products which include cloud mask, column water
vapor and aerosol optical depth, type (background, biomass burning or dust),
and Angstrom parameter, and surface spectral BRF, albedo and Ross-Thick
Li-Sparse (RTLS) BRDF model parameters in 7 land and 5 unsaturated ocean bands.
The 500m gridded land BRF is also produced for MODIS bands 1-7. The BRDF is
currently reported every 8 days. MAIAC data consist of the following three
products:

 1. Daily Surface Reflectance  (MAIACBRF)
 2. Daily Aerosol Optical Thickness (MAIACAOT)
 3. 8-day BRDF model parameters (MAIACRTLS)


 For more information, including the data specification and references, please

*VIIRS*
*******

Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) is a scanning radiometer on
board the NPP satellite. The VIIRS collects visible and infrared imagery and
radiometric measurements of the land, atmosphere, cryosphere, and oceans. It
extends and improves upon a series of measurements initiated by the Advanced
Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging
Spectroradiometer (MODIS). VIIRS data is used to measure cloud and aerosol
properties, ocean color, sea and land surface temperature, ice motion and
temperature, fires, and Earth's albedo. Climatologists use VIIRS data to
improve our understanding of global climate change.

Like MODIS, VIIRS is a multi-disciplinary sensor providing data for the ocean,
land, aerosol, and cloud research and operational users. VIIRS spectral
coverage will allow for data products similar to those from SeaWiFS as well as
SST, a standard MODIS product.

LAADS provide a number of VIIRS data products to the users. These products
include:

- NPP Level 0 Products
- NPP Level 1 Products
- NPP Level 1 5-Minute Products
- NPP Level 1 Daily Products
- NPP Level 2 Products
- NPP Level 2 5-Minute Products
- NPP Level 2G Daily Products
- NPP Level 3 Products
- NPP Level 3 Daily Products
- NPP Level 3 Daily Tiled Products
- NPP Level 3 8-Day Tiled Products
- NPP Level 3 16-Day Tiled Products
- NPP Level 3 17-Day Tiled Products
- NPP Level 3 Monthly Tiled Products
- NPP Level 3 Quarterly Tiled Products

As in the case of MODIS data, VIIR data are also stored in LAADS in a
predefined directory structure based on ArchiveSet (AS), ESDT, Data-Year, and
Data-Day:

/allData/ArchiveSet/ESDT/YYYY/DDD/.

A brief description of Suomi-NPP VIIRS data available on LAADS ftp server for
user download is given below listed by ArchiveSet:

AS3000 - NPP data - An archive of NPP VIIRS xDRs generated at IDPS. This
contains VIIRS xDRs in native IDPS granule size (86 secs) in HDF5 format and
these granules aggregated at Land PEATE to nearest 5min size in HDF4 format.

AS3001 - NPP data - An archive of NPP VIIRS xDRs generated at Land PEATE by
processing the RDRs using the IDPS OPS (Operational) code. All xDR granules
are of ~5min size and are produced in HDF4 format. Also, this archive contains
L2G and L3 daily and multi-day DDRs (Diagnostic Data Records) generated at
Land PEATE by running the MODIS algorithms ported to use the VIIRS L2 xDR as
input  produced at Land PEATE.

AS3002 - NPP data - An archive of NPP VIIRS xDRs generated at Land PEATE by
processing the RDRs, using the Land PEATE Adjusted version of the IDPS OPS
codes and new algorithms delivered by the Science Teams. All xDR granules are
of ~5min size and are produced in HDF4 format. Also contains L2G and L3 daily
and multi-day DDRs generated at Land PEATE by running the MODIS algorithm
using the VIIRS xDR data generated at Land PEATE as input.

AS 3110 -- NPP data â€“ An archive the C1.1 reprocessing data, the follow on to
the C1 reprocessing.  For this data, the best variations of the OPS L1, L2
and limited L3 codes were in use as well as the LPEATE Science DDRs.  The
LUTs in use by the L1 codes were those provided by the VCST group specifically
for the reprocessing, so were not the same as those in use for the C1
reprocessing.  The reprocessing data period started 1/19/12, same as AS3100
and  currently anticipate a continual reprocessing of the latest data month
with revised LUTs from VCST.  No end time for this has been planned.

AS 3144 -- NPP data â€“ A partner archive set to AS3110.  After a significant
amount of reprocessing was completed in AS3110, LPEATE realized that the
stray light correction was not working for the NPP_VDNE_L1 products.  The
integration of the code was corrected for the SDR code (PGE302b), and at the
request of the science team, scaling implemented for the NPP_VDNE_L1 product.
In order to maintain a consistent non-scaled dataset in AS3110, but still
accommodate the needs of the science team, a full reprocessing of the
NPP_VDNE_L1 products using the same LUTs as the C1.1 was executed in AS3144.
Only the NPP_VDNE_L1 products are retained in LAADS.

*eMAS*
******

The enhanced MODIS Airborne Simulator (eMAS) is an airborne scanning
spectrometer that acquires high spatial resolution imagery of cloud and
surface features from its vantage point on-board a NASA ER-2 high-altitude
research aircraft. Data acquired by the eMAS are used to define, develop, test,
and refine algorithms for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
(MODIS).

The enhanced MODIS Airborne Simulator (eMAS) data is now available through our
anonymous FTP site on ladsweb.nascom.nasa.gov. The directory structure is as
follows:

/MAS/<flight number>

The following table provides information about eMAS campaigns and corresponding
dates and flight numbers. These flight numbers can be used to locate data from
the campaign on LAADS.

*AMS*
*****

The Autonomous Modular Sensor (AMS) is an airborne scanning spectrometer that
acquires high spatial resolution imagery of the Earth's features from its
vantage point on-board low and medium altitude research aircraft. Data
acquired by AMS are helping to define, develop, and test algorithms for use in
a variety of scientific programs that emphasize the use of remotely sensed
data to monitor variation in environmental conditions, assess global change,
and respond to natural disasters.

The AMS data is now available through our anonymous FTP site on
ladsweb.nascom.nasa.gov. The directory contains AMS data organized by flight
number and file type. The file types include Level 1B (AMSL1B), Level 2 ice
phase (AMSL2I), and Level 2 water phase (AMSL2W) and the flight numbers are
13_920, 13_921, 13_923, 13_13_924, and 13_925. So, the directory structure is
as follows:

/ AMS/<flight number>/<product>

For example, AMSL1B product files for flight number 13-920 can be found on
ladsweb in the following directory:

AMS/13_920/AMSL1B

Information about the flights for which data are stored on ladsweb is given in
the table below:

+--------+------------+-------------------------------------+-----------+
| Flight | Date       | Location                            | Status    |
+--------+------------+-------------------------------------+-----------+
| 13-925 | 02/06/2013 | Southern California / Pacific Ocean | Level-2   |
+--------+------------+-------------------------------------+-----------+
| 13-924 | 02/03/2013 | California / Pacific Ocean          | Level-2   |
+--------+------------+-------------------------------------+-----------+
| 13-923 | 02/01/2013 | Southern California / Pacific Ocean | Level-2   |
+--------+------------+-------------------------------------+-----------+
| 13-921 | 01/28/2013 | Southern California / Pacific Ocean | Level-2   |
+--------+------------+-------------------------------------+-----------+
| 13-920 | 01/22/2013 | Central California                  | Level-2   |

*MERIS*
*******

The Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) is one of the instruments
on board the European Space Agency (ESA) satellite ENVISAT. MERIS, a
push-broom imaging spectrometer, measures the solar radiation reflected by the
Earth at a ground spatial resolution of 300 m, in 15 spectral bands in the
visible and near infrared wavelengths. MERIS allows global coverage of the
Earth in 3 days.

The primary mission of MERIS is to monitor the ocean color including
chlorophyll concentrations for open oceans and coastal areas, yellow total
suspended matter. In addition, MERIS provides land parameter measurements like
vegetation indices and atmospheric parameters like water vapor, cloud top
pressure, cloud types, aerosol optical thickness, and more.

MERIS data are provided at 3 different levels of processing - Level 0, Level 1,
Level 2 - and at 3 different spatial resolutions - Full, Reduced and Low. They
may also be sorted and visualized very easily using a browse product (RGB
color coded images of full-resolution data). Child products, including a
limited number of measurement data sets, may also be available in reduced and
full resolution.

For the same image, a Full-Resolution (FR) image has 4 x 4 more points (pixels)
than the same image in Reduced Resolution (RR), and an RR image has 4 x 4 more
points (pixels) than the same image in Low Resolution (LR). Accordingly, a
pixel in a FR image represents a ground area of 260 m x 290 m, in a RR image
it depicts an area of 1,040 m x 1,160 m, and in a LR image it covers an area
of 4,160 m x 4,640 m. It is to note that the instrument always takes
measurements with full resolution; i.e., 260 m x 290 m ground resolution and
an onboard averaging generates the RR images, while LR images are generated
during the ground processing by further averaging the RR data.

The MERIS product StartTime and EndTime recorded in LAADS are taken from
the time stamps of the first and last line in the product (FIRST_LINE_TIME
and LAST_LINE_TIME).  The SENSING_START and SENSING_STOP metadata in the
main header are not reliable. More info on MERIS data is available at:

https://earth.esa.int/web/guest/missions/esa-operational-eo-missions/envisat/instruments/meris

The MERIS data is available publicly through LAADS Website at no cost to
registered users who have agreed to the terms and conditions set by NASA and
the European Space Agency (ESA) to access MERIS data. LAADS is providing
following three MERIS products

1. Full Resolution, Full Swath Geolocated and Calibrated TOA Radiance
   (Product ID = MER_FRS_1P).
2. Reduced Resolution Geolocated and Calibrated TOA Radiance (stripline)
   (Product ID = MER_RR__1P).
3. Reduced Resolution Geophysical Product for Ocean, Land and Atmosphere
   (stripline) (Product ID = MER_RR__2P).

The MERIS data are stored at LAADS Web only in a predefined directory
structure based on Archiveset (AS),  Product ID,  Data-Year,  and Data-Day:

490/Product_ID/YYYY/DDD/.

In order to access MERIS data, user has to complete three following steps:

Step 1. Register for an EOSDIS user account through the EOSDIS User
        Registration System. If you already have an EOSDIS user account,
        continue to the next step.

Step 2. Add authorization for the MERIS data to your EOSDIS user account by
        entering your EOSDIS login information and filling out a short form.

Step 3. Visit https://ladsweb.nascom.nasa.gov/MERIS/ and enter your EOSDIS
        login information to access the MERIS data.
